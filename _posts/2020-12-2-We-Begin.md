## Background
I've dabbled in "coding" for many years, on-and-off. Starting with VBA to automate Excel tasks, to learning DAX for Power Pivot/BI expressions, to Python and Pandas. I work in a corporate finance as an "Analyst", but I've come to realize there is a **lot** more to learn to better understand the available data and effectively communicate those findings to others. 

## My Plan
With so many potential paths to my end-goal, it's a little overwhelming to know where to begin. So, I'm just going to jump, see where I land, and adjust as needed. That's always worked out for me in the past.

Since I already have *some* knowledge of Python and Pandas I'm going to go that route as opposed to R. There will absolutely be some math I'll need to learn (or re-learn). I'll need to dive into SQL. And I'll need to figure out Git.

I have taken a course on [DataQuest](www.dataquest.io) before and got a lot out of it, but this time I'm trying to do as much as I can for free (with the exception of purchasing books). However, I reserve the right to make an about-face at any moment.

I recently found an interesting [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTxyviU0Ddo) on a channel called "Python Programmer". In the description the poster leaves a list of *free* resources he recommends to learn Data Science. I'll re-post that this hear for my reference later.
