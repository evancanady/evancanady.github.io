Over the past several years I've sporadically bought books, watched videos, enrolled in online courses, and spent countless hours on Stack Overflow trying to learn Python. All that starting and stopping has made me re-learn the very basics many times over. Which is both annoying and helpful. I've now reviewed 'what is a variable' and 'how to write a function' eight or ten times. Each time I jump back into things I dig a deeper and expand my understanding. It's not the most efficient way to learn something new, but it's working - or at least it's not failing.

Just a couple days ago I finished a [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-python-bible/) on Python. For $12 it was surprisingly good. Definitely for the beginner, but it helped to fill in some cracks in my foundational understanding of things. It's funny how you don't see the crack until you've been shown the piece that fills it in. I've decided it's good to never assume you are too _advanced_ to go back and review the basics from time to time. You can always learn something new and maybe view things from a new perspective.

It's also ~~helpful~~ necessary to have a real-world project that's challenging enough to require continued learning, but not so challenging you give up. I don't need Python, or any coding knowledge, for my day-to-day work, so I have to have little side projects to keep me engaged. I'm hoping to be able to share this one soon.
