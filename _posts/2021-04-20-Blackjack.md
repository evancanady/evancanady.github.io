I wrote a Python program that will simulate a number of Blackjack games. It allows you to change variables like, number of players, number of decks, player hit strategies, and player split strategies. The results of each hand are written to a Pandas DataFrame and pickled where it's then read into a Jupyter Notebook and analyzed. It's still a work in progress.

It's ugly and inefficient, but it's mine and it works (as far as I can tell).
