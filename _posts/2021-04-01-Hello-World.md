They say writing distills your thoughts and highlights gaps in logic and understanding. I suppose that's what I'm trying to do here - to get a better understanding of my own thoughts, beliefs, doubts, biases, strengths, weaknesses. I could go on.

Topics will vary significantly. I will be wrong often; contradict myself; change my mind. The target audience is myself mostly. If someone else takes interest or is inspired I'll be flattered. If I'm inspired to dig into a new topic, reverse an opinion, or make a new connection between ideas I'll be grateful.

Maybe in the process I'll become a better writer too. But until that happens these words land with the grace of a dead bird.

Those things may happen, or they may not. Instead of planning it all out I'll just jump and see where it goes.
