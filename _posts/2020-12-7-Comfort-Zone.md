I spent this past week trying to figure out where to start. Based on a few recommendations I bought *Think Stats* by Allen Downey and tried to use it as a re-introduction to the material. Though, it was obvious after the first chapter that I'm not ready for it yet. The book glosses over some Python/Pandas topics and jumps straight into the mathematical concepts of data analysis. I suppose that should have seen that coming by the title.

So, what did I do? I went back to what was familiar and seemed to work for me in the past: [DataQuest](https://www.dataquest.io). I had already completed some of the introductory work in their Data Science path, but over the weekend I re-subscribed, cleared out some of my old progress, and started over where the concepts were fuzzy in my mind. My original goal was to take advantage of as much free content out there that I could (which I still plan to do), but my true goal is to learn. So, I'll take whatever content I can get my hands on towards that end.

At this point in my education I realize I need some guidance (which DataQuest provides). To a large extent I'm at the point where I don't-know-what-I-don't-know. So, self-guided learning is harder to do well - at least for me.

For now I'll shelve *Think Stats* and pick it back up once I have more of the fundamentals under my belt.
